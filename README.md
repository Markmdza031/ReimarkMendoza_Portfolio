# Project 1 Pasajob Employment Referral Value Predictor
    PasaJob is a long-chain referral-based job platform that rewards individuals for connecting employers with the right candidates. 
    A team of 5 was tasked to collect and scrape data from top online job search platforms and utilize the collected data in 
    developing a machine learning models that can predict referral value of an open position. 

# Project 2 SeeYouDoc Customer Segmentation
     Based on the company's customer data, the team used unsupervised machine learning model to segmentize patients and predict their 
     app usage using Recency, Frequency and Monetary (RFM) model. 

# Project 3 Travel Itinerary Generator 
    In collaboration with a team of 4, a machine learning model prototype  was developed with the use of Natural Language Processing 
    and Network Analysis that returns a recommended travel itinerary based on a keyword input.  
    
# Project 4 Power Plant & Weather Sensor Linear and Multiple Regression Analysis
    A project task was given to our program Data Management and Analytics Program in Bow Valley College, Alberta, Canada. A dataset 
    was provided containing information collected on two solar plants over 34 days. Each pair has one power generation dataset and 
    one weather sensor readings. The task is to find relationships among the data features and give recommendations and inferences
    that would solve the business problem.
